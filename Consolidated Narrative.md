### Dive 1 — Orientation & Core Skills

**Goal:** Comfort, equipment handling, baseline buoyancy control.

**Narrative Sample**

> We are in Roatan, Honduras, preparing for our first boat dive on a Newton, a type of boat with a platform on the back common to North and South America. We are going to dive to a very shallow reef with a MOD of 12fsw. Our dive will last for approximately an hour.
>
> Our goals for this dive are drills and thrills with a focus on safety and initial skill performance. Great luck; our reef has a sandy patch that's 4' deep that we can stand in.
>
> We'll focus on how to:
>
> - Assemble our gear
> - Communicate underwater
> - Dive as a team
> - Manage gas and gear
> - Descend and ascend in a controlled way
> - Work with our regulator
> - Clear our mask
> - Do a basic weight check
> - Fin properly
> - Exit from deep water
>
> All these skills will make our Roatan experience safe and comfortable.

**Pre‑Dive:**

- Briefing: objectives, signals, buddy roles, gas management.
- Equipment assembly and predive checks.
- Entry: giant stride.

**In‑Water Skills:**

- Surface BCD inflation/deflation, snorkel/regulator exchange.
- Controlled descents and ascents.
- Regulator recovery & clearing; alternate air source drill.
- Mask skills: partial and full flood & clear; no‑mask breathing/swim.
- Basic buoyancy: weight check, hover attempts.
- Finning techniques.

**Post‑Dive:**

- Debrief.
- Deep water exit, equipment disassembly.
- Logbook entries.

### Dive 2 — Problem‑Solving & Buoyancy Refinement

**Goal:** Reinforce competency, introduce CESA simulation, gear removal/replacement.

**Narrative Sample**

> We are in the Maldives, preparing for our second confined open water dive from a dhoni, the traditional Maldivian dive boat with an easy rear entry platform. We’ll dive to a shallow lagoon reef with a maximum depth of about 12 feet, and the dive will last roughly an hour.
>
> Our goal for this dive is to reinforce competency and introduce problem-solving skills, including emergency ascent and gear handling. The lagoon’s sandy bottom and calm, clear water make this an ideal setting for practice.
>
> We’ll focus on how to:
>
> - Manipulate our weights at the surface and at depth
> - Assist a tired diver and relieve cramps
> - Hover and maintain trim in gentle currents
> - Remove and replace the BCD at the surface and underwater
> - Perform a Controlled Emergency Swimming Ascent (CESA)
> - Exit from shallow water
>
> These skills will make your Maldives experience safe and comfortable while preparing you for the vibrant reefs!

**Pre‑Dive:**

- Briefing: safety protocols, ascent control, buddy assistance.
- Equipment assembly & predive checks.
- Entry: backroll.

**In‑Water Skills:**

- Hovering & trim practice.
- CESA simulation.
- Remove/replace BCD at surface and depth.
- Weight system removal/replacement.
- Tired‑diver tow and cramp‑relief techniques.

**Post‑Dive:**

- Debrief
- Exit, equipment disassembly.
- Logbook entries.

## Day 2 — Simulated Dives 3 & 4

### Dive 3 — Completing SDI OW Skill Set

**Goal:** Systematize all outstanding OW skills, buoyancy/trim sets, multi‑skill mini‑scenarios.

**Sample Narrative**

We are in the Florida Springs, preparing for our third open water training dive. Today’s entry will be from shore, using the spring basin as our starting point. The water here is crystal clear, with a sandy bottom and limestone ledges—perfect for practicing skills. Our maximum depth will be about 25 feet, and the dive will last roughly an hour.

Our goal for this dive is to complete the SDI Open Water skill set by systematizing all remaining skills and practicing buoyancy and trim in realistic scenarios.

We’ll focus on how to:

- Perform controlled descents and ascents with a simulated safety stop
- Swim without a mask and re-don it underwater
- Execute an out-of-air drill with an alternate air source ascent
- Practice basic navigation techniques
- Maintain environmental awareness: avoid silt, hold trim, and use slow, efficient finning

These skills will make your Florida Springs experience safe and comfortable while preparing you for more advanced dives in varied environments.

**Pre‑Dive:**

- Briefing: emergency procedures, buddy communication.
- Equipment assembly & predive checks.
- Entry: instructor's choice.

**In‑Water Skills:**

- Controlled descents/ascents with simulated safety stop.
- No‑mask swim and re‑don.
- Out‑of‑air drill with alternate air source ascent.
- Navigation basics.
- Environmental awareness: silt avoidance, trim, slow finning.

**Post‑Dive:**

- Debrief.
- Exit, equipment disassembly.
- Logbook entries.

### Dive 4 — Nitrox Practicals + Peak Performance Buoyancy

**Goal:** Nitrox practicals and PPB coaching.

**Sample Narrative**

> We are in the Galapagos Islands, preparing for our fourth training dive from a sturdy dive panga, the type of boat commonly used here for quick access to remote sites. Today’s dive will take place on a sheltered rocky reef with a sandy patch for skill work. Our maximum depth will be about 40 feet, and the dive will last roughly an hour.
>
> Our goal for this dive is to complete Nitrox practicals and refine peak performance buoyancy skills. The Galapagos offers unique conditions—cooler water, occasional surge, and incredible marine life—so precision and control matter.
>
> We’ll focus on how to:
>
> - Analyze Nitrox gas: calibrate the analyzer, verify O₂%, and record in your log
> - Set your dive computer for Nitrox: FO₂, MOD, and PO₂ limits
> - Adjust weighting and trim for perfect balance
> - Hover in multiple positions: horizontal, vertical, and hover turns
> - Streamline gear and use precision finning techniques
> - Check your computer during the dive: confirm Nitrox settings and track NDL
> - Navigate an obstacle course without contact for task-loading practice
>
> These skills will make your Galapagos experience safe and comfortable while preparing you for dives among hammerheads, sea lions, and the region’s famous currents.

**Pre‑Dive:**

- Gas analysis: calibrate analyzer, verify O₂%, record in log.
- Computer setup: set FO₂, confirm MOD and PO₂ limit.
- Briefing: buoyancy objectives.
- Equipment assembly & predive checks.

**In‑Water Skills:**

- Exact weighting and trim adjustments.
- Hovering challenges: horizontal, vertical, hover turns.
- Streamlining and precision finning.
- Computer checks: verify Nitrox settings, track NDL.
- Task loading: obstacle course without contact.

**Post‑Dive:**
